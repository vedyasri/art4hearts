I’m super excited to be part of Art 4 Hearts, a nonprofit organization that spreads kindness and positivity through art. I joined because I believe that art has the power to bring people together and make them feel cared for, and I want to use my creativity to contribute to that mission.
I enjoy collaborating with others, taking on leadership roles, and coming up with new ideas, and I hope to make a positive impact in my community through Art 4 Hearts. I’ve also participated in programs where we organize self-care and community-focused projects, combining my passion for helping others with creativity. I’m looking forward to growing with Art 4 Hearts and sharing art that uplifts and inspires.</h3>
